Here's a great little site that celebrates everyone's love for 90's tv shows — in gif form. Using html/css, javascript/jquery, api calls, and Skeleton as a framework (my new favorite, in fact — love the minimalism), the site allows you to click on exising buttons to load 9 random gif's related to the subject, and to add your own buttons.

Made as a project for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin
