# Giftastic

Here's a great little site that celebrates everyone's love for 90's tv shows — in gif form. This was our first foray into using api calls. I used, for the first time, Skeleton as a framework (my new favorite, in fact — love the minimalism). Giftastic allows you to click on existing buttons to load 9 random gif's related to the subject, and to add your own buttons.

This project was created as an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.
